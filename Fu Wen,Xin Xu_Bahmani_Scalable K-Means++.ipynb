    "Due to its simplicity, the `k-means` algorithm is one of the most famous machine learning algorithms used to cluster data[1]. The main critical problem of this algorithm is that it might be blocked locally based on the initial random chosen centers. The `k-means++` algorithm is developed to solve this problem, spreading out the initial centers with an updating non-uniform distribution. However, `K-means++` has a limited applicability to large data sets due to its inherent sequential nature, which requires k passes through the whole data set to find the optimal initialization of centers. The `K-means||` algorithm in the paper \"Scalable K-Means++\" is the parallel version of the `k-means++`[2] and an improvement. Instead of sampling a single point, it oversamples a couple of centers in each iteration and guarantees the performance at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we firstly implement the `K-means||` algorithm in Python. Then, we speed up the algorithm using `Cython` and parallelize the algorithm using `multiprocessing`. In the applicaiton part, we apply it to the `GAUSSMIXTURE` dataset simulated as in [1] and the `SPAM` dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning repository [3]. We compare the misclassification rate (for `GAUSSMIXTURE` dataset), clustering cost and runtime of the `k-means||` algorithm with the result of random initialization and the `k-means++`. In the end, we inplement `k-means||` algorithm in Spark using `pyspark.millib`. "

    "\n",
    "As one of the most popular clustering algorithms, the **k-means** algorithm has been widely used for the last half of the century[4]. The main idea is to randomly choose k centers, repeatedly assign each point to its nearest center and calculate the new centers by minimizing the sum of the squares of the distance in its neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means algorithm has a critical problem of unreliable initialization[2]. This algorithm with an incorrect initialization cannot find a globally optimal solution but rests on a locally optimal solution. In addition, the running time before convergence is long. **K-means++** algorithm avoids this problem by finding k better initial centers. It first samples one random point uniformly from the data, then sets the subsequent k-1 centers with probability proportional to its contribution to the overall error given the previous centers. In contrast to the k-means algorithm, k-means++ reduces the probability of picking several initial centers in one cluster. However, the sequence initialization process also limits its applicability to large data sets or data with large k since the whole algorithm is not scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bahmani et al. constructed the scalable k-means++ algorithm (**k-means||** algorithm) in their paper \"Scalable K-Means++\"[1]. The main idea is to sample more than one point (O(k)) in each round and repeat the process for fewer iterations ($O(logn)$). Then, the algorithm reclusters the $O(klogn)$ points generated from the above process into $k$ initial centers.\n",

Also, `k-means||` runs faster than `k-means++`, since it runs a fewer number of rounds and been speed up in the parallel implementation.\n",

We firstly tried reclustering the multiple weighted centroids in $C$ into $k$ clusters. Since the initial center for the reclustering is picked randomly, it will have the same problem as using random initialization. Then, referring to some online resources[4], we tried sampling $k$ final centroids from the weighted centroids in $C$ in the last step. But we think it might also get several centroids in one large cluster and lead to an unstable result. \n"
